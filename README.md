# Car-Parking-Sensor
We made a circuit for reverse car parking sensor.
It provides three different noises based on the distance between back of the car and the wall.
We used arduino,breadboard,distance sensor,buzzer,lights,C++,Tinker cad.

It has four different cases 
1) if the distance > 275,
    the buzzer doesn't makes any noise, no led turns on.
2)  if 200 < distance < 275,
    the buzzer makes low noises (frequency = 18Hz) and one of the LED turn on.
3)  if 35 < distance < 200,
    the buzzer makes medium noises (frequency = 23Hz) and two of the LED turn on.
4)  if distance <= 35,
     the buzzer makes high noises (frequency = 29Hz) and three of the LED turn on.
